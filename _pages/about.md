I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://twitter.com/iddbirmingham"
rel="external">International Development</a> at the University of Birmingham.
My research interests include african studies, peacebuilding, statebuilding and
transitional justice.

My current research investigates the role of traditional healers in the
statebuilding processes in post-conflict Mozambique, focusing on traditional
justice and local governance.
